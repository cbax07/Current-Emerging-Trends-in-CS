# Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
The task was to implement deep-Q learning. The goal of the deep Q-learning implementation is to find the best 
possible navigation sequence that results in reaching the treasure cell while maximizing the reward. In 
my implementation, I had to determine the optimal number of epochs to achieve a 100% win rate. Specific parts of this code were given to me. 
I had to code the Q-learning algorithm portion but the build model and environment were set up prior.

# Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science: 
Throughout this course I have gained a broad understanding of artificial intelligence and machine learning.
